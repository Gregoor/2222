# 2222 in Perl with FIGlet

Contributed by John Barrett ([jbarrett](https://github.com/jbarrett))

To play this version:
1. Download `2222-figlet-fatpacked.pl` to your computer.
2. Download `slant.flf`, or one of the other fonts from the [FIGlet font database](http://www.figlet.org/fontdb.cgi).
3. Get a word list, like `2222.txt` from the root of the repo.
4. Put all 3 files together in a folder
5. Make sure you have perl, then run: `time perl 2222-figlet-fatpacked.pl slant .`

The 2nd argument is the name of the font, the 3rd argument is where to look for that font (eg: if you already have a folder of FIGlet fonts elsewhere on your disk.)

The included [Slant](http://www.figlet.org/fontdb_example.cgi?font=slant.flf) font was created by Glenn Chappell in March of 1993. Happy 31st birthday, Slant!
