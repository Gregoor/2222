# 2222 in Perl

Contributed by marcink ([@marcink@stolat.town](https://stolat.town/@marcink))

To play this version:
1. Get a word list, like `2222.txt` from the root of the repo.
2. `cd` to the folder with the word list.
3. Make sure you have perl installed. It's there by default on Mac, probably Linux too.
4. Copy paste the following into your terminal:

```bash
perl -pe's//\ec/;`sleep .6039604`' 2*
```
