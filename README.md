# 2222

"Two Twenty-Two Two" is a game üé≤

for people ü´£ who like to be silly

and know a tiny ü§è bit of programming.

## How to play

Implement the following in a programming system of your choice. The weirder, the better!

#### 1: It loads a list of 2222 words.

You can use the file `2222.txt` in this repo, or make your own list ‚Äî¬†but it needs to be exactly `2222` real words. `2222.txt` is four-letter words. It does have a few cuss words that are fun to say. It only has words that are fun, no bummers.

#### 2: It displays each word for `0.6039604` seconds.

#### 3: As each word appears, you read the word aloud.

Don't stop if you make mistakes. Keep reading until all the words are done.

#### 4: You win!

You can spend as long as you like implementing the game, but I suggest speedrunning this part! Just make it work, be sloppy, be slippy, be silly.

If you implement the game as described above, it'll take roughly 22 minutes and 22 seconds and 0 picoseconds to play. If you play the whole way through, it'll feel _totally bizarre_.

## No Rules!

This game is whatever you want it to be. There are no rules! Have fun!

But‚Äî

There is one rule:

**You have to share.**

That's the most important rule of all.

Here are some suggested ways to share:

* Record or live-stream yourself playing the game.
  * One extra rule in this case: the viewer needs to be able to see your code.

* Submit your implementation to me, so I can add it to this repo!
  * You can make a PR, open an issue, message me on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@spiralganglion), find me at SPLASH con in October and hand me a CD-R, or whatever.

## Watch me play

But, like‚Ä¶¬†spoilers. I suggest giving it a try for yourself first.

## Variations

Variations are encouraged! For instance, here's what I call the **speedrun** variation:

* Shuffle the order of the words.
* Keep track how many times you mess up.
  * Eg: Make it so that if you mash something on your keyboard, it increments a "deaths" counter.
* Instead of advancing the words every `0.6039604` seconds, add a button to advance to the next word.

With these rules, scoring works as follows:

* Any% ‚Äî¬†Try to get as far as you can without messing up. Your score is how many words you said before you messed up. Higher score is better.
* 100% ‚Äî If you get all the way to the end without messing up, your score is your time. Lower is better.

Lots of other variations are possible ‚Äî go nuts.

**Good luck, have fun!**
